This blogpost has been created as part of a lab workshop on using [git version control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) and has been a great excuse to share and discuss interesting papers that have influenced our work!

### Bioinformatics Papers

*Flic Anderson:*

["Best Practices for Scientific Computing"](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001745) pulls together ideas for how to produce readable, shareable code that will deliver reliable results worth publishing. It's informed by the authors' involvement in the [Carpentries Organisation](https://carpentries.org/) and it's inspired me to train as a Carpentries Instructor to help teach [data and software workshops](https://edcarp.github.io/) as well as using the skills day to day in my developer work on [riboviz](https://github.com/riboviz/riboviz).


### Functional Genomics Papers

*Edward Wallace:*

["Defining the essential function of yeast Hsf1 reveals a compact transcriptional program for maintaining eukaryotic proteostasis"](https://dx.doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.molcel.2016.05.014) is a neat paper that takes a hard problem and makes it seem easy. Since the 1980s, it was known that **Heat shock factor 1** is an essential gene required for transcription of heat shock protein genes. But it wasn't known why it was essential - which regulatory targets of Hsf1 are actually relied on by the cell? My then-officemate Eric Solís started working on this, and I had little idea what he was so excited about at the start. His work grew into this elegant story that uses genetics, ChIP-seq, RNA-seq, etc, to dissect Hsf1's function away from everything else going on. This paper is a great model of how to take a "pleiotropic" regulatory factor and find out its specific regulatory functions.

Some of my lovely Chicago colleagues wrote a perspective on this work - [Heat Shock Factor 1: From Fire Chief to Crowd-Control Specialist](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2016.06.026).

*Eszter Denes:*

[Candida glabrata Drug:H+ Antiporter CgQdr2 Confers Imidazole Drug Resistance, Being Activated by Transcription Factor CgPdr1"] (https://aac.asm.org/content/57/7/3159) describes many experiments that can be conducted in order to show that a particular gene causes antifungal resistance in fungi. What is more, the authors also tested which transcription factor controls this gene’s expression levels.
As my PhD project is about antifungal adaptation, I find this paper very informative and inspiring.
