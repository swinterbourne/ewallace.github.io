# Act now or people will die from COVID-19

The viral pandemic COVID-19 is here, and we must [act *now* or people will die](https://medium.com/@tomaspueyo/coronavirus-act-today-or-people-will-die-f4d3d9cd99ca). As that blogpost explains, COVID-19's fast exponential spread, 2-week latency, and low testing rate provoke complacency. The decisions we make today affect how many people will die in 2 weeks time and beyond, and so we should take action today to flatten the curve of infections.

Inspired by Leslie Vosshall's twitter thread, [How to keep science-ing safely in a pandemic](https://twitter.com/pollyp1/status/1237523543077736448), here's suggestions on how to be safer and also productive during the epidemic. I wrote this for my lab and am happy to share it.

# Be safe - avoid people as much as possible

Social distancing is an effective containment measure. The risk of transmission goes with the square of the number of people: a seminar or bus with 50 people is *100x* as risky as a meeting with 5.

## Be safe in your life outside the lab

### Stock up on prescriptions, consider human food and pet food.

### Ideally cancel personal travel and large public events

## Rethink your experiments

### Downsize/postpone experiments where possible

### Order critical reagents now

### Develop list of critical lab functions and volunteers to do them

This will help if/when the university is closed to non-essential personnel.

## Don't go to meetings in person

### Lab meetings and 1-1s will be online until further notice

1-1s I prefer [https://whereby.com/ewallacelab](https://whereby.com/ewallacelab).

Lab meetings probably zoom or skype for business - this is work in progress.

### Don't go to seminars

Ask for a remote option where possible. This is upsetting because of course we want to hear other people's science. Yet the risk squares with the number of people.

### Cancel work travel

Will anyone die if you don't make that trip? No? Don't go.

## Work from home if you can

If you must go to work, for example if something will catch fire or mice will die:

### walk/bike to work

### avoid public transportation

### drive in if you must

## Prepare your computers

### Install and test VPN and remote desktop

[UoE VPN](https://www.ed.ac.uk/information-services/computing/desktop-personal/vpn)

[UoE remote desktop](https://www.ed.ac.uk/information-services/computing/desktop-personal/off-site-working/remote-desktop)

### Put all the data you need somewhere sensible

For us that means UoE datastore, which is backed up to tape.

### Install any other software you might need

# You can be plenty productive during the epidemic

Everyone, in my lab at least, has some written or computational work that will move their project and their career forward. Even the most dedicated experimentalist has data to analyse, papers to read, etc. Perhaps something you have been putting off doing. What a wonderful opportunity to focus on that instead, without guilt! So ask yourself, and then discuss:

## What data analysis do I need to do?

* That qPCR experiment from December that we never quite cleared up?
* Re-analysing that sequencing dataset with different software?
* Turning that half-informative figure into a really good clear figure?
* Comparing the data from last month's journal club paper with my data?

## What do I need to plan

* That fiendishly complicated multi-sample experiment?
* The new cloning strategy?
* The critical path for the series of mutants I need to make?

## What do I need to learn?

Edward will be delighted to discuss and to recommend resources.

### Skills

* Design of Experiments?
* Statistics, regression modeling, Bayesian analysis?
* Data visualisation, e.g. ggplot?
* Project management?
* RNA-seq data processing?
* etc., etc.

### Knowledge

* Evolutionary history of my organism?
* Recent work on the protein/process I'm working on?
* Classic work from the '80s relevant to my project?
* How motif-finding algorithms work?
* Literature in a different species related to my project?
* Background on how our tools work (fluorescent proteins, silica columns for RNA extraction, microscopes, chemistry of crosslinking, ...)
* etc., etc.

## What do I need to write?

* The section of results covering my last 3 months' work?
* An even better experimental protocol on protocols.io
* The methods section of the paper
* Your next grant or fellowship application?
* The paper my PI has been asking me to write for a month?
* A review paper, which will double as the introductory chapter of your thesis?

## What should I prioritise?

* Where do I want my project to be in 6 months time?
* What do I need to complete my next paper?
* What is the most important thing I don't understand?
* What could unblock my project?
* What will I get the biggest sense of accomplishment from?
