# Welcome to the Wallace lab!

Starting in a new place there is a lot to keep track of.
This page is intended to list all the essentials to get started.

<a name="communication"></a>

# Communication expectations

Talk to people! Ask questions! Answer questions! Admit when you don't know the answer! All nicely, of course.

Most _internal_ lab communication happens on slack first. When it's helpful to talk to someone "in person" or by call - ask to set it up. In person is hard right now due to COVID-19, but video and phone calls are doable.

Most _external_ communication happens on email. If you're asking a lab business-related question, if in doubt cc Edward, if it's about the wet lab space cc Rosey.

For wet-lab workers, please share your mobile phone number (where?) for use _only_ in emergencies.

We have a "Wallace lab" calendar that is currently on google calendar; most events are posted there and some are listed on slack as well.

These are asynchronous communication channels - *you don't need to respond immediately* - it's not useful to be constantly "on call" and it's bad for your mental health. Set notification schedules on slack so that you aren't disturbed when you're focused on a task or you're off work, and ignore emails then too. However, *please respond to email & slack messages within one ordinary working day*, i.e. when you're not on leave or doing a stressful timecourse. If you don't have a full response, it's courteous to respond saying "I don't know, can I get back to you tomorrow/next week/when I've done some reading". If you're not working, set an autoreply to do that for you. If you ask someone else a question and they don't get back to you, ask again the next day.

# Access 

The lab is in [the Waddington building](https://www.ed.ac.uk/maps/maps?building=ch-waddington) on King's buildings campus. [How to travel to the King’s Buildings](https://www.ed.ac.uk/transport/travelling-here/kings-buildings). However, due to COVID-19 restrictions, you will have to discuss with Edward and the building manager how much your work requires building access before attempting to go there.

Get your student/staff card as soon as possible, from [card services](https://www.ed.ac.uk/information-services/help-consultancy/card). To get access to the Waddington building, email synthsys administrator Julie Fyffe and cc Edward. If allowed after the opening hours use card then enter your card PIN (see [card help](https://www.ed.ac.uk/information-services/help-consultancy/card)) to access building. This is all subject to special risk assessments and agreements during Covid.

## Lack of access

Remote working is hard, whether due to COVID-19, or any other more specific reason. We'll talk about it and figure out the best solution we can.

<a name="where"></a>

# Where do we belong?

Physically, we are in the Waddington building on the Kings' Buildings campus, address and info [on the contact page](/about.html#contact).

Organisationally, we are in the [Institute of Cell Biology](https://www.ed.ac.uk/biology/cell-biology), which is part of the large and diverse [School of Biological Sciences](https://www.ed.ac.uk/biology). In turn, SBS is part of the [College of Science and Engineering](https://www.ed.ac.uk/science-engineering). Most adminstrative stuff that lab members have to deal with is at school level, some at institute level.

Note: Before it got too large and was split up into the current institutes, there was an Institute of Cell and Molecular Biology (ICMB), which is still the name used for the seminar series.

We are affiliated with the [**SynthSys** Centre for Synthetic and Systems Biology](https://www.ed.ac.uk/biology/synthsys). This is a vibrant research community of people who, like us, are interested in interdisciplinary studies of biological systems. SynthSys has a nice fortnightly meeting, seminar series, socials, and lots of opportunities for collaboration and science talk. 

<a name="planning"></a>

# Planning 

We are currently operating a COVID-19-distanced shift system for wet lab work - please discuss with Edward and Rosey, and get clarity on your allocation.
 
We also have a rhythm of meetings to support and communicate our work.

* Weekly lab meetings, currently Mondays 16:00-17:00. (Attendance near-compulsory)
* Fortnightly 1-2-1 meetings with Edward, usually on Tuesday or Thursday, sign up in the lab calendar by agreement. (Attendance compulsory)
* Journal Club - this has sometimes run monthly, depending on the current level of enthusiasm in the group. It's really rewarding when it works. (Attendance strongly encouraged)
* Many Mondays, ICMB seminar (Attendance usually valuable)
* Alternate Wednesdays, ICMB internal seminars (Attendance encouraged) - this is the best way to learn about what other people in the institute are doing
* Alternate Thursday mornings: SynthSys Open Centre Meeting (9:30 talks; attendance encouraged) - this is the community meeting for synthetic and systems biology colleagues
* (pre-COVID) Last Friday of the month: Synthsys happy hour (5pm drinks, 6pm Pizza; attendance rewarding).  

You can find all the important information on the google calendar of the Lab. 

There are [many interesting seminars in the school of biological sciences, listed on the website](https://www.ed.ac.uk/biology/news-events/events-and-seminars). SynthSys, ICMB, and infectious disease seminars are also listed there.

# Computing

There are a lot of different online tools, it's hard to keep track of, this is the friendly guide.

## University username (UUN)

First you'll need your university email account including a *UUN* and password. For students, UUN will be your student number `sXXXXXXX`, for staff it will involve initials and some of your surname, like Vlad Sanchez' might be `vsanche1`. Most university services are accessed through [myed](https://www.myed.ed.ac.uk/), and for myed and many other sites you will have to login using a system called "EASE" - this means using your username and password. For all the other tools, it will usually be best to sign up with your university @ed.ac.uk account. 

There are many help pages available on these tools at [information services](https://www.ed.ac.uk/information-services/), and you can ask questions via their [IS helpline](https://www.ed.ac.uk/information-services/help-consultancy/contact-helpline).

The university's email goes by default to [outlook](https://outlook.office.com/owa/?realm=ed.ac.uk), although it is possible to set up with other clients. Outlook has the dubious advantage of interfacing with the outlook calendar system, sharepoint, microsoft teams, and so on.

## School of Biological Sciences wiki

[SBS wiki](https://www.wiki.ed.ac.uk/display/SBSIntranet/Home+Page) has a lot of useful information, although some of it is hard to find and/or out of date.

## Accounts to create

### Slack - lab talk

[Wallace lab slack workspace](https://wallacelabworkspace.slack.com/) - this is where most of the lab talk happens. Sign up first so you can ask other questions there.

### VPN - off-campus access

For many off-campus options including Datastore, Eddie, and journal sites, you connect through the VPN.

Register for a VPN account using: [information services vpn site](https://www.ed.ac.uk/information-services/computing/desktop-personal/vpn). 

### Datastore - the university's shared data storage space

[DataStore is a file store for active research data, and is available to all research staff and postgraduate research students](https://www.ed.ac.uk/information-services/research-support/research-data-service/during/data-storage). To request access, there is a [new link as of September 2020](https://www.ed.ac.uk/is/request-datastore-access). 

Please request access to the lab's space, `csce/datastore/biology/groups/wallace_rna` a.k.a. `smb://csce.datastore.ed.ac.uk/csce/biology/groups/wallace_rna`. Edward authorizes access to this datastore storage area. 

#### Mapping datastore drives on your computer

To access datastore drives as if they were on your computer (this needs checking):

1. Click Start > Computer, select Map network drive and choose any available letter. 
2. In the Folder box, type the share's path `\\sg.datastore.ed.ac.uk\csce\biology\groups\wallace_rna` or (windows) `smb://csce.datastore.ed.ac.uk/csce/biology/groups/wallace_rna`
3. Select Reconnect at logon and Connect using different credentials and click Finish. 
4. Enter your username in the format ED\username and put in your University password. 
5. Select Remember my credentials and press OK. 

### Sciquest - buying lab stuff and computer stuff

If you're going to be ordering things (computer equipment, lab reagents etc.), sign up for [sciquest, instructions here](https://www.edweb.ed.ac.uk/procurement/eprocurement/sciquest). Graham and Davey at Roger Land Stores handle sciquest access for SBS.

### Expenses

For expenses (e.g. conferences, outreach, travel) you need to have an account on [eExpenses system](https://www.ed.ac.uk/finance/finance-training-hub/finance-systems/eexpenses).

This is due to be replaced by the [People and Money system](https://uoe.sharepoint.com/sites/ServiceExcellenceProgramme/SitePages/Core-Systems-Frequently-Asked-Questions.aspx?CT=1600244032049&OR=OWA-NT&CID=db9141e8-712e-8971-05aa-882e91124b82) in April 2021. So don't rush to sign up.

### RSpace - Electronic lab notebook.

[Rspace](http://rspace.is.ed.ac.uk/) - this is the electronic lab notebook that is used by everyone who works in the wet lab. 

To get an account, email [data.support@ed.ac.uk](mailto:data.support@ed.ac.uk) and cc Edward, subject: Add user to Wallace lab Rspace, and include your UUN.

Subsequent logins go through EASE. 

There is a lot of help available, e.g. [new user tutorial](https://rspace.is.ed.ac.uk/workspace?simpo-walkthrough=2ba644dacb96d081dea670fdd06620dc), [RSpace helpdocs](https://researchspace.helpdocs.io/).

Please link your datastore to RSpace as well. (Sep 2020: needs new help link)

We are working on guidelies for how to write lab notebook entries to go in the lab manual, watch this space and discuss with Edward

### protocols.io - protocol sharing

We use [protocols.io](https://www.protocols.io/) to write, share, edit protocols. It's a great site! Create an account with your @ed.ac.uk email address. Ask to join the [Wallace lab for Fungal RNA group](https://www.protocols.io/workspaces/wallace-lab-for-fungal-rna).

protocols.io integrates with RSpace and also with slack. This means that you can link your lab notebook page to the protocol you used, discuss a protocol with the rest of us, and so on. 

protocols.io, like RSpace, is a service that we pay for access to via an institutional subscription. Don't be embarrassed to ask for help, we are paying for that service.

### Eddie - high performance compute server

For really big analysis needs, we tend to use [Eddie from ecdf](https://www.ed.ac.uk/information-services/research-support/research-computing/ecdf/high-performance-computing). They have all the power you need, helpful tutorials, etc.

Often it is helpful to run medium-sized jobs on [bifx](http://bifx-core.bio.ed.ac.uk/wiki/index.php/Main_Page), the server at the Wellcome Centre for Cell Biology. Ask Edward about this. 


### ORCID

[ORCID](https://orcid.org/) provides a persistent digital identifier (an ORCID iD) that you own and control, and that distinguishes you from every other researcher. Set one up, it will be useful.

### git, github, gitlab

We use git extensively as version control software, to share data and code within the lab and across the world. Even the lab website is hosted on [github](http://github.com/). Please create a github account. Then, create your team page on the lab website as [described in the README.md](https://github.com/ewallace/ewallace.github.io).

The University also has something similar, [a private instance of gitlab](https://git.ecdf.ed.ac.uk/), which we sometimes use, and which uses the UUN/EASE process.

## Email lists to join

Edinburgh manages mailing lists through [the mlist server](https://mlist.is.ed.ac.uk/lists).

Please join:

* `synthsys-all` - the synthsys centre email list.
* `synthsys-lab` - people who use synthsys lab space (if doing *wet* lab work in Waddington building)
* `waddington_occupants` - anyone who occupies any space in the Waddington building.
* `icmb` - the institute for cell biology, etc.

To join these, it is often easiest to email Julie Fyffe, [synthsys](http://www.synthsys.ed.ac.uk/) administrator, and cc Edward.

Depending on your interests, you may also wish to join:

* Edinburgh Infectious Diseases mailing list - email [Hilary Snaith, EID administrator](eid@ed.ac.uk)

## Software to install on your local computer

* R: https://cran.rstudio.com/ 
* Rstudio: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/ 
* tidyverse R packages: https://www.tidyverse.org/
* Python: the cool kids install this with [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) nowadays
* Snapgene: https://www.snapgene.com/ - synthsys has a licence
* Inkscape: https://inkscape.org/
* Zoom: [use the university's service](https://www.ed.ac.uk/information-services/computing/comms-and-collab/zoom)
* Surely there must be some others?

If you are a new start and you don't have an adequate laptop for your work, talk to Edward, and we will find a way to fix that. The program or school funds laptops for all new PhD students.


<a name="wetlab"></a>

# Wet lab

There's a number of accounts and setup tasks relevant to getting going in the wet lab. Safety comes first, although here it's listed after.

## Wet lab - Android tablet

We have Android tablet computers that live in the lab that you can use to take notes, take pictures of experiments and upload them directly to your lab notebook by RSpace. Use this! First you will need to set up an account on the tablet kept in your bay.

There is also a windows tablet used to control the lab microscope (does that have accounts???)

## Wet lab - synthsys scheduler

For use of many items of lab equipment - plate readers, fragment analyser, qPCR machine, and so on - you need an account on [the synthsys scheduler](http://synthsys.bio.ed.ac.uk/biosched/index.php). The page is accessible from campus or the VPN. 

Plate readers tend to be in high demand, join the plate readers mailing list (how??). You may have to join the weekly "plate reader" booking meeting if you are going to use them regularly. 

## Wet lab - DNA sequencing

Sign up for a DNA sequencing account at [MRC PPU in Dundee](https://www.dnaseq.co.uk/). We use them for routine Sanger sequencing of constructs. Wallace lab code is 2248, and the lab address as the invoice address.

## Wet lab - facilities

For fancy fluorescence microscopy, the [Centre Optical Instrumentation Laboratory (COIL)](http://coil.bio.ed.ac.uk/) is a Wellcome Trust funded facility containing the most up to date imaging equipment. COIL also has a scheduler that you need to sign up for to use.

The school has [other facilities with great specialised equipment](https://www.ed.ac.uk/biology/research/facilities). Genomics, proteomics, etc.

## Wet lab - other considerations (incomplete)

* opentrons pipetting robot
* centrifuges
* we have a tube labeling machine
* we have a lot of equipment, but lack a single list of all the stuff we have. Ask people!

<a name="safety"></a>

# Safety

We take safety seriously. If anyone were to be careless, there would be a number of ways to damage yourself or other people involving chemicals, explosions, and opportunistic pathogens. We *must* follow the [health and safety guidance from the  School as described in SBS wiki](https://www.wiki.ed.ac.uk/display/SBSIntranet/Health+and+Safety). We also need to learn about the risks, how big they are, how to avoid them, and generally how to take care.

Some examples of genuinely dangerous things that affect our work:

* Fungal pathogens such as _Cryptococcus_ are dangerous to immunocompromised or pregnant people.
* It's 2020, and we are in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic.
* Microwaves heating liquids can cause scalding, or if containers are sealed can cause explosions that can cause serious damage.
* Reagents for lysis and extraction, such as betamercaptoethanol, phenol, and trizol, melt flesh and cause burns. In large quantities they are lethal.
* You can set your hair on fire with a bunsen burner.

All these things can be low risk if thought about carefully. Know the risks and know the preventative measures. Discuss these with your colleages and with Edward.

If you notice anyone doing anything dangerous or risky, talk to them and talk to Edward.

## Training

The Health and Safety Induction and the Buildings Induction are now on [Learn](https://www.learn.ed.ac.uk/). It can be a bit difficult to find things on Learn, the H & S one can be found by searching the course catalogue for “safety induction” and choosing the relevant one (e.g. PhD) and the buildings one by searching “SBS Buildings Induction”.

Once you have completed the buildings induction you should contact the building manager, who will send some building-specific info as well. Someone in the group should do a tour of the building with a view to fire safety, pointing out:

* Fire alarm activation points nearest the lab/office
* Fire escape routes and exits
* First aid kits, first aid room and how to contact a first aider
* The day and time of the fire alarm test

## Risk assessments

In lab Waddington 2.18 we have a folder of risk assessments covering procedures. These should all be looked over. Those that affect your work must be read, understood, and signed, before you will be allowed to work in the lab. If there are any errors or omissions in the risk assessments, please alert Rosey and Edward immediately.

## Liquid nitrogen

The university has special training measures for Liquid Nitrogen, following a few nasty accidents. To sign up, get a code and information by emailing [SBS safety](mailto:sbsafety@ed.ac.uk), and cc Edward, with subject line "sign up for liquid nitrogen training".

<a name="edward_checklist"></a>

# Edward's Checklist

* Request building access
* Invite to Slack
* Invite to lab Google Calendar
* Request RSpace access
* [Invite to protocols.io Wallace Lab for Fungal RNA](https://www.protocols.io/workspaces/wallace-lab-for-fungal-rna/manage?tab=members) 
* Check all safety documentation signed
* Have reassuring conversations about everything

<a name="fix_things"></a>

# Fix missing things

Is there something that you needed to know that wasn't covered here? Ask the lab on slack. Ask other people until you get an answer. 

Then [edit it on the website github](https://github.com/ewallace/ewallace.github.io/blob/master/manual/_posts/2020-09-07-newstart.md), so that the next person who needs it can benefit too.
