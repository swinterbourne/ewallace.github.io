# Design and Implementation

I was inspired by, and built from, [The Drummond Lab](http://drummondlab.org/about.html) website. This in turn was built from a design from [Trevor Bedford]( http://bedford.io/team/trevor-bedford/).

The site's source code is freely available on [GitHub]. All code is placed under the MIT license.
